## Hi There! — I’m Nakul.

Most days, I’m tucked into a research project or following an idea that showed up sometime between late night and early morning.  
I like working where biology meets computation — messy problems with just enough structure to make them fun.

Lately, I’ve been focused on bioinformatics, healthcare AI, and figuring out how to make data behave.  
A lot of what I build lives in private repos or quiet notebooks, but I’m always working on something — writing, refining, iterating.

When I’m not buried in LaTeX or a dataset, I’m usually out cycling, in the kitchen cooking something improvised, or coaxing an old computer into running like new. 
Each habit has taught me something: patience, rhythm, and the value of staying calm when things fall apart.

I like slow starts, clean ideas, and believe — wholeheartedly — that sleep is the best coffee.
