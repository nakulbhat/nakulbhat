👋 Привет!, I'm Nakul! 

🌍 I'm passionate about technology, cycling, cooking, and leadership and management. In addition to my interests in these areas, I have a deep love for reading books, especially true crime. I also love to keep streaks, presently having a Github, Leetcode and Duolingo streak going; helping me become better at Spanish, Russian and making the green roll in.

🌱 I'm currently in my first year of university, eager to learn and explore various fields, from coding to experimenting with new recipes and enhancing my leadership skills. While I'm not yet ultra-pro-level fluent in any programming languages, I have a knack for "Frankensteining" - combining different elements creatively.

🚀 I learning to collaborate on open-source projects and learn from the community. <br> I'm a fan of Custom ROMs and modding/rooting them. I'm currently figuring out a way to get Pixel Experience up an running on my Xiaomi Redmi Note 10S. Any guidance/advice will be appreciated
