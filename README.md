👋 Hello, I'm [Your Name]! 

🌍 I'm passionate about technology, cycling, cooking, and leadership and management. In addition to my interests in these areas, I have a deep love for reading books, especially true crime.

🌱 I'm currently in my first year of university, eager to learn and explore various fields, from coding to experimenting with new recipes and enhancing my leadership skills. While I'm not yet fluent in any programming languages, I have a knack for "Frankensteining" - combining different elements creatively.

🚀 I love to collaborate on open-source projects and learn from the community.
